release_summary: |
  Hotfix release for requests 2.32.0 compatibility.

  Please note that this only fixes problems with the vendored Docker SDK for Python code.
  Modules and plugins that use Docker SDK for Python can still fail due to the SDK currently
  being incompatible with requests 2.32.0.

  If you still experience problems with requests 2.32.0, such as error messages like
  ``Not supported URL scheme http+docker``, please restrict requests to ``<2.32.0``.
